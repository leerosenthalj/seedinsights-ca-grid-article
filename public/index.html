        <h2>DESIGNING CALIFORNIA'S NEW POWER GRID</h2>
        <p>California’s commitment to 100% carbon-neutral energy poses
          challenges for its existing infrastructure. Caltech researchers have
          created a tool that can help design a more resilient energy grid.</p>

  <h2>The Renewable Revolution</h2>
  <p>Do you know where your power comes from? If you are charging your device while reading this article, you are probably plugged in to the local power grid. The router that connects you to the internet, the lights in your building, and your refrigerator are all powered by the grid. We take this power for granted; electricity is always available exactly when we need it.</p>
  <p>Power grids are among the most complex and critical networks in modern-day society. California’s power grid alone is a massive network of generators, transmission lines, and substations that supply over 500,000 megawatts of electricity every day.</p>
  <p>California’s power grid is about to undergo a transformation. In September 2018, governor Jerry Brown signed SB-100 into law, committing the state to 100% zero-carbon energy supply by 2045. The law requires that at least 60% of California’s new zero-carbon energy will come from renewable sources, such as solar and wind.</p>

  </div>
  <p>Increasing reliance on renewable sources is crucial for a more sustainable energy system, but it can also threaten the reliability of the grid. The way the state handles the transformation to carbon-free energy will determine whether it will be able to support itself with a consistent, reliable supply of renewable energy or end up with a brittle system prone to failures and blackouts.</p>

  <h2>The Grid Today: Supply and Demand</h2>
  <p>The power grid today is a top-down system that has been designed to distribute energy from large power plants to consumers as a one-directional flow. The current grid is very reliable, with an energy supply that is easily adjustable to rise or fall with changes in load.</p>
  <p>The graph below shows California’s demand for power throughout the day on a typical day in January. This demand, also known as load, varies slightly throughout the day and peaks in the evening.</p>
  <hr class='start-viz'>
  <div id='energy-demand' class='line-chart'>
  </div>
  <hr class='end-viz'>
  <p>Although traditional sources of energy such as the two largest in California, natural gas and hydropower, are readily ramped up or down to match load, solar and wind energy sources function a little differently. Solar power faces a particularly large obstacle: its energy output is entirely dependent on when the sun is shining. A sunny day can be a great source of power - until clouds form, or the sun goes down and no energy is being produced at all.</p>
  <hr class='start-viz'>
  <div id='renewable-production' class='line-chart'>
  </div>
  <hr class='end-viz'>
  <p>Only having solar energy during the day significantly changes the shape of the load curve. An abundance of solar power means that other sources don’t need to produce as much to meet overall energy demand during the day. The net load on the power grid, or demand minus solar supply, has a large dip during the day and a rapid increase toward peak demand in the evening. This shape is called the duck curve, and presents several challenges that make reliability more difficult.</p>
  <hr class='start-viz'>
  <div id='duck-curve' class='line-chart'>
  </div>
  <hr class='end-viz'>
  <p>Wind has somewhat different obstacles, akin to solar use on partially cloudy days. Wind farms depend on a resource that can vary significantly on short time scales, making individual farms an inconsistent power source. The wind isn’t tunable like the output from natural gas plants, and its energy output in local areas may be intermittent even on days that the state’s overall average wind energy output looks smooth.</p>
  <p>Because of these unique challenges, a grid that relies heavily on solar and wind can be at risk of failures and blackouts if it is not carefully designed to be resilient.</p>
  <h2>Renewables and Risk</h2>
  <p>To function properly, the grid must maintain a perfect balance between power demand and power supply. Grids that rely on fossil fuels are highly controllable and can readily adjust to changing demand, but grids that rely more on solar and wind production don’t adjust as easily. This makes the system vulnerable to power surges and blackouts.</p>
  <p>When a transmission line experiences a power surge, it may be damaged or its protection mechanisms may trip. Once a line fails, the power that would have flowed through it redistributes to neighboring lines. If any of these lines are overloaded and fail in turn, the problem spreads to even more transmission lines. In this way, the failure of a single transmission line can lead to cascading failures and cause a large-scale blackout.</p>
  <hr class='start-viz'>

  </svg>
  <hr class='end-viz'>
  <p>Because reliance on renewables can increase the risk of power surges and blackouts, drastic action is sometimes required to keep a renewable grid up and running. For example, during a particularly windy period in 2007, China had to deliberately idle one third of all of their wind turbines because their grid was dangerously close to overloading.</p>
  <p>Even today, California often has to throttle back its solar energy production to prevent grid overload. If the state hopes to increase its dependence on solar and wind power without making this problem worse, it needs to be able to quantify the failure risk of different parts of the grid and make design decisions that minimize this risk when expanding its renewable infrastructure.</p>
  <p>Besides the fact that we can’t control when the wind blows or the sun shines, another factor makes it difficult to integrate more renewables into the grid: solar or wind farms that are geographically close together have highly correlated output. </p>
  <p>For example, a particularly gusty day in Kern Country could affect not just a single wind turbine but all the turbines at Alta Wind Energy Center, the largest wind farm in the United States. A particularly strong gust that hits many turbines at once would cause a sudden burst of power generation that could overload nearby transmission lines.</p>
  <p>The same problem affects solar farms--if multiple solar farms are clustered near each other, their electricity output will generally rise and fall at the same time as the sun rises and sets and clouds pass by. The solar eclipse of August 2017 resulted in a huge solar production dip, and network operators had to analyze the situation in advance to ensure there would be no disruptions in power supply.</p>
  <p>Clustering too many solar or wind farms can increase the risk of power surges when output spikes or “brownouts” when not enough power is available. As California continues to invest in renewable infrastructure, it needs to do so in a way that minimizes this risk. </p>
  <p>Luckily, researchers from Caltech and Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica in Amsterdam are investigating just that.</p>

  <h2>Modeling The Power Grid: Design Matters</h2>
  <p>Using statistical methods, researchers are able to predict which power lines in a grid are most likely to fail. They model a power grid as a network of places where electricity is produced (e.g. generators) and consumed (e.g. cities), which are connected by transmission lines.</p>
  <hr class='start-viz'>

  </svg>
  <hr class='end-viz'>
  <p>The model assumes that the power supplied by each generator and the power consumption in each city/district both fluctuate randomly around a set average value. This results in random fluctuations in the power flowing through the lines connecting the nodes. If the power flowing through a line exceeds its capacity, it may overload and “fail”. </p>
  <p>Using high-dimensional joint distributions for fluctuations in power, the model is able to identify the lines that are most prone to failure. Understanding which transmission lines are most vulnerable allows preventative actions to be taken to prevent cascading failures and resulting blackouts. In the map below, the failure risk of each transmission line is indicated by its color.</p>

  <hr class='end-viz'>

  <p>As California looks to expand its renewable energy production, a seemingly natural strategy could be to enlarge current wind and solar farms, since they have likely purposely been placed in windy/sunny areas where they can be highly effective. However, applying the model to this situation shows that this approach worsens the risk of failure.</p>
  <p>This happens for precisely the reasons discussed in the previous section--if more wind turbines are added to a small geographical area, energy output will increase more steeply when the wind gusts, leading to a greater risk of overload. If the infrastructure connecting these farms to nearby cities is not upgraded accordingly, risk rises even higher.</p>

  </svg>
  <hr class='end-viz'>
  <p>By contrast, a grid structure where renewables are less clustered together results in a more reliable and less failure-prone network. This approach is also more economical, in that higher reliability standards can be achieved with fewer infrastructure investments.</p>

  <h2>Looking to the Future: Managing Risk for a Reliable Grid</h2>
  <p>The intermittent and volatile nature of renewable energy production would not be an issue if we could bank energy and use it when the wind is not blowing or the sun is not shining. However, bulk storage technology is not mature yet as there is currently no affordable option to store energy in large volumes. To comply with SB 100, California will thus need to adopt new control mechanisms and focus on redesigning the grid as it is today. There are a number of approaches that could help the grid become safer and more reliable.</p>
  <p>Myopic infrastructure decisions can lead to very risk-prone scenarios, as outlined in the examples above. The first strategy to keep the grid safe and reliable as renewables scale up is making strategic and well-informed infrastructure decisions while fully account for the spatio-temporal correlations of renewable generations. In particular, we should build long-range transmission lines to balance out renewable energy across larger areas. </p>
  <p>This idea is intimately related with that of a national energy grid. A nation-wide more interconnected and centralized grid is supported by clean energy analysts as it would improve energy efficiency, increase implementation of renewables, and lower energy rates. The challenge is in identifying how exactly transmission lines will be expanded, keeping fluctuating energy supplies and demands in mind, across such a grand scale of states, regions, and other jurisdictions with varying timelines and priorities. In this respect, the model developed in the article can be an important tool for grid expansion planning, since it can be used to evaluate what benefits or risks of adding new lines or new renewable generation. </p>
  <p>Another complementary effort should be made on the demand side. Indeed, the grid would greatly benefit if we could reduce the magnitude of demand peaks and to distribute the energy consumption more evenly across the day (cf. duck curve) or when there is a large renewable energy production.</p>
  <p>In order to do achieve this, a necessary step is a widespread adoption of smart meters. Smart meters enable users to be more aware of (and possibly adapt) their energy consumption and, at the same time, they would allow energy managers (aggregators?utilities?) to anonymously collect data that would allow them react more promptly to demand changes or pinpoint more easily failures, making restoration of power faster and more dependable. This technology is already mature and, in fact, already in 2016, Germany committed $23.6 billion to implement smart metering throughout its grid.</p>
  <p>The capability of smart grids are further supported by the increasing penetration of distributed energy resources, such as residential solar panels (which are now required on new houses in California CITE) electric vehicles, and home batteries. Collectively, distributed energy resources can be connected to the grid and allow energy users to shift some of their demand to energy resources as local as their own backyards. Distributed generation can even allow users to monetize their own energy production by selling excess energy back to the grid.</p>
  <p>The next step would then be implementing on a large scale programs that would encourage residential or business customers to draw on electricity at different hours or even better allow the grid to directly reduce the energy supply to specific households/businesses for short periods of time. In this scenario the network operator could temporarily switch off some electrical appliances (fridges, pool pumps, AC machines, etc.) which energy demand can be deferred in time by some minutes without a major impact on their functionality. In this way, at aggregate level the grid would become more flexible, being able to shave peak demand and respond better to emergency situations or contingencies.</p>
  <p>Electric vehicles could also provide helpful ancillaries services to the grid, if they could adapt their charging rate to the current grid situation, e.g. temporarily pause their charging in the moment of peak demand and charge instead where there is an excess of renewable power in the system. In fact, electric vehicles can be seen as a large distributed population of “moving batteries”, which, with a reasonable flexibility on the customer side and an appropriate coordination could help balancing out renewable power without the need of expanding stationary storages, as outlined in this research article https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/aabe97/meta</p>

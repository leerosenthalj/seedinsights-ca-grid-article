  <p>Here are the pie chart drafts. Open issues:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Are our numbers for 2017 exactly right? This is from a chart that
      combines 2017 data on imports and production (but doesn't take into
      account any potential exports). It's not clear if this is the same thing
      as consumption, which is what SB100 regulates.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Here are the first drafts of our line charts. This isn't real data, just
    the general "gist" for each chart. Each one will be accompanied by a short
    paragraph of text in the final version (see 3rd draft doc). Open issues:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Which charts do we want y-axis labels on? Just the first one? I'm not
      sure about what the first chart is measuring (California? Whole US?) so
      definitely need to double-check that.</li>
    <li>For the natural gas, solar, and wind charts, where are we getting the
      data? Is a rough sketchy approximation OK?</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Draft of map with 2017 data. Hover over a node to highlight everything of
    that class. Open issues: </p>
    <ul>
      <li>What else do we want to pop up when a class is "highlighted"? Extra
      information about that class of node?</li>
      <li>What other data/numbers do we want to display all the time? Not sure
      what would be useful. Percentage of production for each class? Also...
      is it weird that this is "production" once again, when what SB100 regulates
      is consumption?</li>
